# the-mitrokhin-project
A project to train an AI on the Mitrokhin corpus to detect Russian TTP patterns in a body of text, actions or biographical data.

# Goal
This project aims to create an open-source AI model and training regimen based on the Mitrokhin documents to help generate real-time analysis of text/news/biographical data grading alignment with known Russian "TTP"s, along with justifications for the grading. I hope to be able to include potential counter-actions for any source information provided to the AI.

This is an open-source project so that anyone with interest can contribute, fork, etc to increase usefulness and uptake.
